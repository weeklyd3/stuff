THE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR ARTICLES POSTED 
=======================================
This file highlights the rules for 
articles that are posted on this website.

Please note that a violation of this
code of conduct will result in the 
user's article being deleted from the
server.

1. CONTENT
All content in articles should not
include:
 * vulgar language (or "bad words").
   Anything that is considered 
   offensive by major dictionaries
   is considered "not allowed."
 * copyright violations
 * Malicious CSS that misleads the
   properties including, but not 
   limited to:
    * ::before
	* ::after
	* display
	* visibility
	* color
	* background-color
 * Malicious links meant to infect
   computers on purpose. Sometimes,
   users think the link text is the
   actual URL, so gaining false 
   trust by doing this is not allowed.
2. LICENSES
People can enforce their own licenses
for content they post. However, they
cannot re-brand the source files or
images made by someone else as their
own without prior premission.
