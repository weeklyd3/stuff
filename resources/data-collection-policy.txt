This document shows the
data we collect and why
we do so.
 ● The name and article
   title is collected. 
   This is used solely
   to categorize the
   posts, and is only
   stored on the web
   page. Unless you
   post, it is stored
   in local storage.
 ● Images inserted into
   the article are
   converted into data
   URIs, and do not
   contain metadata.
